### Quick Tips

**ccusage** - Run this daily to track your AI spending. Most people spend $5-20/month.

**Claude Code** - Your main assistant. Just type `claude` and describe what you want to build.

**Vercel** - Type `vercel` in any website folder to deploy it live instantly. Great for sharing projects!

**Cursor** - Open this instead of VS Code. It has AI built into every feature.

**Warp** - Use this instead of Terminal. It makes command-line work much easier.

## For SlideAgent Users

After running the setup script:

1. Navigate to your SlideAgent folder
2. Run `uv sync` to install Python dependencies
