# Script to create ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md if it doesn't exist and append content

CLAUDE_FILE="$HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md"

# Content to append/create
CONTENT='## Follow-up Prompts
**ðŸš¨ ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED - NO EXCEPTIONS ðŸš¨**

**IMPORTANT**: After answering any question or completing any task, always end your response with a section titled "**Next Steps:**" that includes 5 follow-up prompts. These should be:

- The most likely next questions or tasks based on the current context
- Copy-pasteable prompts that continue the agentic interaction naturally
- Focused on progressing the current work or exploring related areas, whatever you think is most useful to drive the ball forward.
- Formatted as a numbered list for easy selection

The goal is to make the workflow more efficient by providing ready-to-use prompts that anticipate the user'\''s next needs.

### Example Format:
```
**Next Steps:**
1. [Most likely immediate follow-up]
2. [Related task or question]
3. [Alternative approach or exploration]
4. [Debugging/testing related prompt]
5. [Documentation or cleanup task]
```

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they'\''re absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.'
